    "TensorFlow is an open source library for fast numerical computing. The API is nominally for the Python programming language, although there is access to the underlying C++ API. It an run on single CPU systems, GPUs as well as mobile devices and large scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines."

    "Computation is described in terms of data flow and operations in the structure of a directed graph.\n",
    "- Nodes: Nodes perform computation and have zero or more inputs and outputs. Data that moves between nodes are known as tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays of real values.\n",
    "- Edges: The graph defines the flow of data, branching, looping and updates to state. Special edges can be used to synchronize behavior within the graph, for example waiting for computation on a number of inputs to complete.\n",
    "- Operation: An operation is a named abstract computation which can take input attributes and produce output attributes. For example, you could define an add or multiply operation."
